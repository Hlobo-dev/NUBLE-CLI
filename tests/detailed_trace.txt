SUMMARY
================================================================================

  Signal distribution:
    Long:    0/7 (0%)
    Short:   0/7 (0%)
    Neutral: 7/7 (100%)

  Regime distribution:
    VOLATILE: 7/7

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

    🔴 ISSUE 1: Too many NEUTRAL signals (100%)
    
       The signal generator outputs 0 when raw_signal is between -0.2 and +0.2.
       
       In a trending market like NVDA (+1235%), we should NOT be sitting in cash!
       
       FIX: Reduce the neutral threshold from 0.2 to 0.1, or add a regime bias
            that pushes signals in the direction of the trend.
        

    🔴 ISSUE 2: Too many VOLATILE regime detections
    
       The simple regime detector (vol > 0.02) is too aggressive.
       Tech stocks like NVDA naturally have higher volatility.
       
       FIX: Use HMM regime detector instead of simple threshold.
             Or adjust the volatility threshold based on asset class.
        

    🔴 ISSUE 3: Not detecting BULL regime enough
    
       NVDA went up 1235% but we're not seeing BULL regime consistently.
       
       FIX: The mean_ret > 0.001 threshold is too strict.
             Daily returns are noisy; use rolling average or HMM.
