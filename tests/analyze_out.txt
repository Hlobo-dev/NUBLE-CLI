ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
============================================================

🔴 ISSUE: Too many SHORT signals in a bull market!
   
   Going SHORT while the market goes UP = DOUBLE LOSS
   (you lose the upside AND you lose from the short)
   
   FIX: In BULL regime, SHORT signals should be very rare.
        Consider: NO SHORTS in BULL regime.


🔴 ISSUE: Still too many NEUTRAL signals!
   
   Sitting in CASH while market goes UP = missed gains.
   
   FIX: In BULL regime, default to LONG unless strong bearish signal.
